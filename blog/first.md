# Languages of next decade

Go, Rust, Dart, Python

The distributed systems triggered the creation of a new generation of languages. There are so many of them but a few will survive and thrive. It seems these thriving languages are going to rule the software development for the next few decades, unless a new crisis shows up.

-   Java, C# ==> Go
    -   Enterprise languages is merging towards Go. Its simplicity and paralilism makes the collaborative easy.
-   C++ ==> Rust || Go
    -   If the speed and memory is the most important factor, you need to use Rust. If working with a large group of collaborators is crucial (which means readability and simplicity are the ruling factors) then Go is the one to go.
-   JavaScript ==> TypeScript || Dart
    -   I believe we are at the peak of JS domination. The frontend development is evolving from browser based to smart displays and Dart started getting traction as the de-facto language (using Flutter) to be the language of client devices.
    -   Anothe possibility is Typescript to replace JS (or JS evolve to be Typescript). The biggest problem with JS is that its no-owner organization made it to be very slow to evolve. Even Deno is replacing NodeJS slowly.
-   Python, R ==> Python
    -   It seems Python is going to be the scripting language for another few decades. Data Science is evolved to be called Machine Learning and Python is the language.
-   Apple Ecosystem ==> Swift
    -   Apple has its own clean, modern language: Swift. There is no bargaining or choice about it.
-   Android Ecosystem ==> Kotlin
    I still believe Android team made a mistake by choosing Kotlin instead of moving towards Dart. Nothing against Kotlin but Virtual Machine languages (Java and C#) are a thing of past. Nevertheless, Kotlin is Andoroid choice of language. If you want to develop an app I recommend Flutter.

So, yes I believe you are better off to learn Python, Go, Rust, and Dart.
Off course, there are other honorable languages that are niche like Haskel and Lisp but the above cover the roadmap
