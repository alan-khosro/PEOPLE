# Experiences with Data Science Modeling

Ali Khosro <br> For Internet Brands <br> A sample of my work (design document): https://storage.googleapis.com/khosro/index.html?file=order-prediction

-   Analysis of Gold Market, Macroeconomics Data for trends in capital markets

    This is related to the work I did right after graduation in an equity firm

-   Time Series Analysis of Online Sale Prediction

    This was related to work I did in Accenture for MS Office sale

-   Bug prediction

    We had a dataset of the past softwares and features and their attributes (complexity, number of files, programming language, line of codes, developers, etc) and we wanted to predict the bugs in test phase and in user experience phase.

-   Web Lead Score

    This one I was the Lead Engineer but the work was done by a junior data scientist. We needed to know the probability of a "web visitor" becomming a "shopper/booker" using mainly demographic data and data gathered from Google Analytics.

-   Smart Ticket Routing

    At Infosys, we needed a system to read user input in tickets and assign it the right team to resolve. I led the project from Data Science to implementation to user interface to deployment in cloud.

-   Setimental Analysis

    I was the supervisor for this project and was done by a senior data scinetist at Capgemini client. I was mainly involved in design and not implementation or coding. And then I led the deployment on cloud. The problem was to scrape comments from TripVisor to find out keywords in different categories and sentemental analysis about the sailing experiences.

-   Clustering

    A have done a few clustering problems. One problem was related to the clustering of business customers based on their characteristics and past purchases from our products.

-   Classification

    I have done more than a few classifications that I do not remember all of them. But I mention one here: Assigning Sales Leads for discount and for sale pursuit.

-   Anamoly Detection

    This one was one of the best project I did regarding innovation and the impact that it had. Our client had transactions in the order of millions (thousands on daily basis) and could not detetct the fraud transactions. I developed an algorithm based on similarity matrix to find "anomalies" in clustering kind of setup (clustered transactions using DB-SCAN) and find the one that are not similar to others as the "suspecious" transactions to audit.

-   Factor Analysis

    I have done a few factor analysis during my graduate studies and my work experiences: impact of developed features on phone calls, impact of family strcture on voting preferences, etc.
