# Answers To Free Agency Questions
Ali Khosro

## Open AI

### 1. What is your most significant technical achievement?

Technical leadership of a 2 years project to implement an analytical data domain (Cassandra), APIs (NodeJS), and ML platform (Python) on top of high volume operational data. It provided a platform for data scientists, reduced (significantly) latency for aggregate APIs, retired many legacy systems (cost reduction), and became a blueprint for other data domain architectures.

#### 2. Where can we find samples of your code?

A few of my projects are open sourced. Most of them were enterprise projects but there were a few projects that I developed for the job but could convince to put on public repo: https://github.com/alan-khosro

### 3. Where can we find your publications, papers or research?

No publication in the past 10 years.

### 4. Please share anything else you want us to know, such as your motivation to apply or additional context for your application.
I love to build novel products, appreciate craftsmanship, be part of making a better technology, believe in AI and ML movement that it is as important as industrial revolution, and learn. OpenAI is agile, futuristic, and the best in AI. Moreover, I have many hands-on skill sets and leadership qualities that would make me a valuable team member in a fast-moving and challenging company like OpenAI. 

### 5. When can you start a new role? *
Immediately

## Spokeo

### 1. Check each statement if it applies to you:
- [X] I've done data analysis for a marketing function of a company
- [X] I've used Google Analytics (or another web analytics) in my data analysis work
- [X] (more precisely, I led a project that used Tag Manager at Meta for ad tracking) I've used GTM (or another tag management system) in my data analysis work.

## Anthropic

### 1. Why do you want to work at Anthropic? (We value this response highly - great answers are often 100-300 words)

Very briefly because it is "Cutting Edge" in technology (futuristic and exciting), devoted to public benefit (nothing makes me more proud that helping community), founded by credible and successful individuals (who were leading OpenAI), a great place to learn and contribute (I crave learning and building like an inventor), is an startup (I have entrepreneurship qualities and decided to join a startup), and works on AI (which I believe is as important as industrial revolution).  

Moreover, I have very diverse technical skill sets and leadership qualities that would make me a valuable contributor to develop high-quality, responsible AI products. My solid educational background in Statistics and years of developing or leading ML, Web, and Data projects matched Anthropic needs very well. I am also very proficient in Google Cloud for solution architecture, development, and pushing projects to production. Anthropic is like a perfect match for my skills and enthusiasm.

The AI revolution (which we are just at the very beginning of it) is extremely powerful as it is dangerous. I know the technology cannot be stopped (even if it was desirable to stop it) and rules and regulations have a very limited impact. I am not sure how I can be part of contributing to it while stopping the destruction aspect of it but I know some visionary people have the answer or the solution will emerge, I just need to be in a place that the solution happens. Anthropic is a great candidate for such a responsible solution.  

I have learned that building a valuable product (especially in software development) is an extremely difficult project that needs people with diverse skill sets and qualities. I have learnt how to be part of such a team, how to take ownership, start a project or task from ideation and lead or contribute until it becomes a functioning product and keep improving it. I would like to be part of Anthropic team to build a responsible, futuristic, high quality, and valuable AI products.

### 2. One part of this role is to talk to our users about our API. In one sentence, how much experience do you have with APIs used by 3rd-party developers?

At T-Mobile, I led a team to develop capability and experience APIs that other internal teams and UI developers would use. Most of these APIs were developed developed on Cassandra + NodeJS (and Python) + Kafka + APIgee technology stack. Separating APIs to two sets of capability and experience came after communicating with API users and to decouple responsibilities. A good part of my job was working with different stakeholders to design such APIs. Of course, I have been the user of many APIs as well.

### 3. When is the earliest you would want to start working with us?
Almost immediately.

### 4. Do you have any deadlines or timeline considerations we should be aware of?
No
