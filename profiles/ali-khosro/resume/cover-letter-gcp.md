**Greeting 66degrees!**

I learned about your company through a GCP seminar and I am excited about joining your team.

I am a proficient developer and architect for GCP and have led a team of engineers for MLOps development on GCP, cloud transformation from AWS to GCP, and have architected multiple projects on GCP. I have also led engineering teams to adopt the trunk based software development for ML projects. I have been the owner of an analytics data domain for a top telecommunication company.

My background is in data science and statistics and recently I was architecting and managing Machine Learning, Data Management, and Data Science projects on public clouds.

I am fluent in Python and TypeScript/JavaScript having developed production projects, I know Golang well (developed small DevOps projects).

I follow thought leaders in software management including Agile, eXtreme Programming, and Trunk Based CI/CD.
Many of your GCP positions look very exciting to me such as Delivery Manager and GCP Architect.

I am looking forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards
