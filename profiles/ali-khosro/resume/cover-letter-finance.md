This is Ali. I have an advanced degree (MA, ABD) in economics (financial economics concentration) and an MBA and Engineering. I used to teach Public Finance and Statistics in abroad colleges. 

I have worked in consulting for data science management roles for the past 6 years. I gained valuable skill sets in machine learning, project and people management, and software delivery.

I am looking to break into the financial industry which I know the best and I am actively looking for opportunities. I live in Seattle.

I appreciate it if we can connect to see if I am a good fit for your open opportunities.
