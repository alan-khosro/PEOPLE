- A good looking person looks fit when height (h) and length (l) are proportional.
     => ideal length / height = fixed for everyone
- The wrist measures your width (w)
- weight is proportional to volume (v) = h * l * w

length = volume / (height * depth)
fixed = l / h = v / (h * h * w)

7 inch wrist (male) => 70 / (1.66 * 1.66 * .18) = 140
6 inch wrist (female) => 1.66 * 1.66 * 15.25 * 140 = 60

7 inch wrist (male) => 153 / (66 * 66 * 7) = .005
6 inch wrist (female) => 66 * 66 * 6 * .005 =  131

So measure your height (h) and wrist (w) then use the following formula to find your ideal weight to look fit and in-shape:
(metric system: meter and kg) ideal weight = h * h * w * 140
(american system: inch and pound) ideal weight = h * h * w * .005
