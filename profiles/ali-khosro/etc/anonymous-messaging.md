## Motivation
I have worked in teams and organizations that a toxic behavior would bug me and some others but we could not raise our concerns since it would make us volnurable. I wished there was a "secret, anonymous" messaging system that we could share our thoughts with anonymity and secretly. 
On the other hand, we do not want this to be used as a "rant" messaging so many limitations such as no trashing, bad talking, too much messaging, sabataging, etc. should be in place.
The sender must become total secret. The invitation should be limitted to the team members in a bigger setting (at least 100 people).

## roles
- sender
    - last 5 messages time
    - point
- receiver(s)
- reviewer
    - reviews anonymous messages to weed out unacceptable messages (foul langage, policy violations, etc)
- bot

## point distribution
if Person sends n messages in past year, each message's weight is log(n)/n
