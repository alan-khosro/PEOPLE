## notes

-   /index.html uploads (markdown) viewer which shows file
-   viewer accepts query parameters:
    -   file: the relative path of the markdown file or you can give file name predefines in viewer.js variable urlMapper (like file=resume)
    -   stylesheet: is the markdown stylesheet file name (without css extension). default is "markdown.css"
